**Intent** is a modern digital wellbeing application designed to help you regain control over your digital life. By introducing mindful pauses before you open distracting apps, Intent encourages you to reflect on *why* you're picking up your phone.

## ✨ Features

### 🧘 Mindful Interventions

Stop the scroll before it starts. When you open a monitored app, Intent presents a calming pop-up that asks:

* **How are you feeling?** (Log your mood)
* **Why are you here?** (Set an intention)
* **Take a breath.** (Customizable 5s, 10s, or custom timers)

### 📊 Insightful Dashboard

Track your journey to digital mindfulness.

* **Screen Time & Sessions**: See exactly how much time you're spending.
* **History Log**: Review your past interventions, moods, and notes to identify patterns.

### 📱 Beautiful Widget

Keep your goals front and center with the Material 3 Expressive widget.

* View daily screen time and session counts right from your home screen.
* Dynamic layout that adapts to your wallpaper (Light/Dark mode support).

### 🔒 Privacy First

Your data belongs to you.

* **100% Local**: All data (moods, notes, stats) is stored locally on your device using Room Database.
* **No Tracking**: We don't send your data to any servers.
